                                    <p class="text-muted">Think of staking more like a vote of trust. Your funds will never leave your wallet. You pledge a vote of trust of a certain value to a Stake Pool, meaning you trust that stake pool efficiency to mint blocks. As a reward for your trust, that stake pool will share the income generated by the transactions with it's delegators - you!</p>
