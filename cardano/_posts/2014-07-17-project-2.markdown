description: Deadalus and Yoroi are two digital wallets where you can keep and manage your crypto assets. There are many other options out there but these two allow you to stake your ADA to a Stake Pool directly from the wallet app. With a couple of clicks you can find our wallet in the 'Delegation list', searching for 'PACT'.
